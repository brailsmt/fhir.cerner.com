## Overview

The Device resource Implementation is currently limited to devices such as pacemakers that are implanted in a patient as part of a charted procedure. As such, this resource currently exposes the known implant history for a patient occurring at this site. 

_Soarian Clinicals_<sup>Â®</sup> supports a read-only Application Programming Interface (API). This API accepts `GET` and `POST` based [search] interactions. The response represents the most current information about the patient that is charted in _Soarian Clinicals_ at the time of the query. 

The search results include the following fields if they contain values:

* [Device id](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/device-definitions.html#Device.id){:target="_blank"}
* [UDI carrier](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/device-definitions.html#Device.udiCarrier){:target="_blank"}
  * [Device identifier](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/device-definitions.html#Device.udiCarrier.deviceIdentifier){:target="_blank"}
  * [Carrier HRF](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/device-definitions.html#Device.udiCarrier.carrierHRF){:target="_blank"}
* [Status](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/device-definitions.html#Device.status){:target="_blank"}
* [Distinct identifier](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/device-definitions.html#Device.distinctIdentifier){:target="_blank"}
* [Manufacture date](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/device-definitions.html#Device.manufactureDate){:target="_blank"}
* [Expiration date](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/device-definitions.html#Device.expirationDate){:target="_blank"}
* [Lot number](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/device-definitions.html#Device.lotNumber){:target="_blank"}
* [Serial number](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/device-definitions.html#Device.serialNumber){:target="_blank"}
* [Type](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/device-definitions.html#Device.type){:target="_blank"}
* [Patient](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/device-definitions.html#Device.patient){:target="_blank"}
