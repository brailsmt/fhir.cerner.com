# Bulk Data Access API
The Bulk Data Application Programming Interface (API) in Health Level Seven<sup>®</sup> (HL7<sup>®</sup>) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources<sup>®</sup> (FHIR<sup>®</sup>) provides a compatible FHIR<sup>®</sup> system application access to potentially large volumes of information on a group of patients. Examples of where this is useful include research, quality measure calculations, and population health applications.

The traditional, interactive FHIR<sup>®</sup> API is excellent for retrieving small amounts of data in near real time. The use cases mentioned above may require many thousands of such queries to be satisfied, which is not practical. The FHIR<sup>®</sup> Bulk Data Access API was designed to address these scenarios.

## Summary
Client applications that interact with the Soarian Clinicals<sup>®</sup> Bulk Data API operate under the system persona, implying that no human is assumed to be directly interacting with it. The API secures the client application using Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 and OAuth 2.

The client application must be registered with Cerner and enabled for the healthcare organization, as well as capable of maintaining a client secret to ensure its authenticity. See [Authorization](https://fhir.cerner.com/authorization/) for more information.

The client application requests bulk data from Soarian Clinicals<sup>®</sup> by issuing an HTTP GET request, specifying the $export operation, to one of two endpoints:

* GET [fhir base]/Patient/$export: Retrieve bulk data for all patients in the system.
* GET [fhir base]/Group/[id]/$export: Retrieve bulk data for a predefined group of patients.

In response, Soarian Clinicals<sup>®</sup> acknowledges the request in near real time. The acknowledgment of a successful request includes a Content-Location header that contains the absolute URL of an endpoint for status requests.

After the export request has been accepted, Soarian Clinicals<sup>®</sup> begins to generate one or more files in NDJSON format that contain the bulk data matching the request. The time that this process takes ranges from very short to very long, depending upon the amount of data that qualifies for inclusion based on the request.

Once it has received the initial acknowledgement, the client application may poll Soarian Clinicals<sup>®</sup> for the status of the file build using the polling location URL provided in the Content-Location header:

* GET [polling content location] to retrieve the status of the bulk data request

Soarian Clinicals<sup>®</sup> then returns one of the following responses:

* 202 Accepted: The export operation is in progress.
* 200 OK: The export operation is complete.

The body of the 200 OK status response contains links to the NDJSON formatted files that contain the requested bulk data. The client application can download these files.

At any time after the initial bulk data request has been acknowledged, the client application can request that it be deleted:

* DELETE [polling content location]: Delete content generated by the request.

If the above DELETE request is sent before the bulk request has completed, the in-flight request is canceled, and any associated content is marked for deletion from the server.

Cerner recommends that client applications always explicitly delete requests after they have finished downloading bulk data. Healthcare organizations have the option of configuring their systems to reject what seem to be duplicate requests. Deleting a request ensures that a subsequent request with the same parameters is not rejected as a duplicate.

### Registering Client Applications

Before a client application can interact with the Soarian Clinicals<sup>®</sup> Bulk API, it must obtain an asymmetric key pair and register its public key set with Cerner. Once a client application is registered, the Soarian Clinicals<sup>®</sup> Bulk API treats it as preauthorized. This enables the client application to obtain access tokens at runtime after authenticating itself. See [Authorization](https://fhir.cerner.com/authorization/) for details on registering client applications and obtaining access tokens.

### Requesting Population Data—Kickoff Request

Soarian Clinicals<sup>®</sup> supports two endpoints for bulk data requests: one for All Patients, and another for a specific Group of Patients.

To retrieve information related to all patients in the Electronic Health Record (EHR), access the following endpoint:

	GET [fhir base]/Patient/$export?:parameters
	
To retrieve information related to a specific group of patients in the EHR, access the following endpoint:

	GET [fhir base]/Group/[id]/$export?:parameters
	
_Implementation Notes_

Be aware that a request for all patients’ data has the potential to consume a significant amount of system resources for a long time. Cerner strongly recommends that implementers retrieve information for specific groups of patients, rather than all patients. If you access the All Patients endpoint, consider using parameters to limit the amount of data returned.

Depending upon the hospital’s policies and configuration, the ability to return data on all patients may be limited or disallowed. The availability of system resources (for example, file space) may also limit responses to requests for all patients (or any query that is too broad).

Note: The examples provided here are non-normative and replaying them in the public sandbox is not guaranteed to yield the results shown on the site.

### Errors

The common [errors] and [OperationOutcomes] may be returned.

## Population Data—Delete Request

Soarian Clinicals<sup>®</sup> supports bulk data delete requests initiated by client applications.

If the delete request specifies a bulk data export request that is in progress, the export request is canceled, and any files associated with the export request are marked for deletion.

If the bulk data export request completed previously, any files associated with the export request are deleted.

### Headers

<%= headers head: {'Accept': 'application/fhir+json', 'Prefer': 'respond-async', Authorization: '&lt;OAuth2 Bearer Token>'} %>

### Example

Request

    Insert sandbox dynamic example
	
In this scenario, the polling content location matches the value returned in the response to the initial bulk data request.

Response
A successful response includes:

* HTTP Status Code 202 Accepted
* FHIR OperationOutcome resource in the body

	Insert sandbox dynamic example
	
Note: The examples provided here are non-normative and replaying them in the public sandbox is not guaranteed to yield the results shown on the site.

### Errors

The common [errors] and [OperationOutcomes] may be returned.

## Population Data—Status Request

Once a bulk data request has started, bulk client applications can query its status by issuing an HTTP GET to the polling content location associated with the bulk data request.

### Headers

<%= headers head: {'Accept': 'application/fhir+json', 'Prefer': 'respond-async', Authorization: '&lt;OAuth2 Bearer Token>'} %>

### Example

Request

    Insert sandbox dynamic example
	
Scenarios where polling content location matches the value returned in the response to the initial bulk data request.

Responses

A status request has the following possible responses:

* In Progress: Soarian Clinicals® is building the bulk data response but has not yet finished it.
* Error: Soarian Clinicals® encountered an error while building the bulk data response.
* Complete: Soarian Clinicals® finished building the bulk data response and it is ready for download.

	Insert sandbox dynamic example
	
Note: The examples provided here are non-normative and replaying them in the public sandbox is not guaranteed to yield the results shown on the site.

#### Example – In Progress

A successful response includes the following messages:
* HTTP Status Code: - 202 Accepted
* X-Progress: A string estimating how much of the bulk data response has been built

	Insert sandbox dynamic example

#### Example – Error

A successful response includes the following messages:
* HTTP Status Code: 4XX or 5XX.
* FHIR OperationOutcome: This information is included in the body of the error response.

	Insert sandbox dynamic examples
	
This error response indicates that the operation has completely failed, that is, no NDJSON files containing bulk data have been created. In the case where the operation has partially succeeded (some— but not all— NDJSON files containing bulk data were created), the response indicates a Complete status.

#### Example – Complete

A successful response includes the following messages:
* HTTP Status Code: 200 OK

The body of the response includes a list of output file URLs in the output array element.

	Insert sandbox dynamic examples	
	
A partially successful response also includes a list of output file URLs in the output array element, pointing to data files that were successfully created. The response body also contains an error array element, which contains a list of URLs that point to NDJSON OperationOutcome resources that detail the errors encountered.

	Insert sandbox dynamic examples
	
### Errors

The common [errors] and [OperationOutcomes] may be returned.

## Population Data – File Request

As mentioned in previous sections, the status response for a completed request includes a list of output file URLs and if applicable, a list of _OperationOutcome_ URLs. The client application may now download these files using these URLs.

### Headers

<%= headers head: {Authorization: '&lt;OAuth2 Bearer Token>'} %>

### Example

### Request

	Insert sandbox dynamic example
	
Where the URLs point to the download location.

Note that a valid access token must be supplied with the download request. The most recently obtained access token can be used if it is unexpired. Otherwise, a new access token must be obtained using the refresh token. See [Authorization](https://fhir.cerner.com/authorization/) for details.
